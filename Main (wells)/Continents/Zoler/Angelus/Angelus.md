"The Kingdom of Angels", now Angelus is young nation formed by the conqueror [[King]] [[Brax Tugor]]. 

It is a swampy and inhospitable land that was populated by warring tribes, small settlements, and bandit clans. This state made it so [[Leviathan]] never bothered trying to colonize the land, deeming it not worth the time and resources.

Unlike the mainland, the [[Al-Rackic Peninsula]] was a place of civility due to the influence of the [[Citadel]] and its divine presence.

**Current Standing**
As of [[Campaign 1]], King Brax has died, leaving his young son in control of the nation. This has led to political instability, with factions quickly forming among the powerful cities of the nation.

**Major Cities**
- [[Angelus (City)]]
- [[Maris]]
- [[Citadel]]
- [[T'Crace]]
- [[Gostrin]]
- [[Graydier]]
- [[Ardent Bled]]

In Campaigns
Angelus is the setting of [[Campaign 1]], [[Campaign 2]], and [[Campaign 3]].

**Military**
While it may not have a unified navy, the [[Angelian Army]] is robust, though unconventional. Originally each separate army was led by a warchief of their own tribe, they trained and led this army without much if any input from the King. After the founding of the nation, this stayed fairly similar. 

Commanders did have to answer directly to the king, but each army was allowed to follow its own training regimen and be specialized in unique ways. While this was effective in practice, after the death of King Brax, some of these commanders now saw an opportunity to grab power.

[[Sergeant Major Bertrand]] and [[Zudon Ridley]] both served in the Angelian Army during the [[Angelian Unification War]]. 

**Economy** 
Trade is the main driver of the economy in Angelus. Despite the inhospitable conditions, Angelus is home to many and rare natural resources. The primary trading partners of Angelus are [[The Zidren Desert]] and [[Caliceerom]] via southern ports away from possible Leviathan influence. 

Other trade partners include the the democracies of [[Olegarion]]: [[The Rathan Republic]], [[Aldritch Republic]], [[Gadzons Union]], [[Naga]], and [[Savron]]. The [[United Olegarion Navy]] is responsible for the protection of trade ships as Angelus as no unified navy.
