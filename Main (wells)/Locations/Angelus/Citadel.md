"The Citadel" is a massive city located on the [[Al-Rackic Peninsula]]. It was founded by a number of figures chosen directly by major gods, the [[Citadel Council]].

Its history predates the history of [[Leviathan]], and though not directly stated, its presence is often thought to be part of the reason why Leviathan never conquered the land of [[Angelus]].

**Campaign 1**
During [[Campaign 1]], [[The Indentured]] work directly for the citadel. They report to [[High Inquisitor]] [[Urgen Roth]], chosen of [[Asmodeus]] and member of the [[Citadel Council]].
