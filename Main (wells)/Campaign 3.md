**MARIS** - Sessions 1 - 2
The campaign begins in the city of Maris. After the destruction of the [[Citadel]], refugees have flooded Maris, with thousands being taking residence both and outside of the city. Calypso has taken up residence in Maris after leaving [[The Indentured]]. 

Calypso lives in a small residence in the city outskirts, the best available given the current over-occupation of the city. She lives with two roommates, Vult and Sumner von Linde, two [[Catfolk]] that also escaped the Citadel. Calypso works under [[Widgeon Waldeck]] and her magic smithery as an employee in training.

Upon receiving a summons, Calypso meets with Maris's mayor, [[Adrian Dumpho]], and a former noble of the Citadel, [[Webster Bryant]]. They inform Calypso about the impending civil war and Maris's unusual position. They ask Calypso to gather information from Angelus's major cities about their alignment to better Maris's position. 

Calypso was chosen for this task after previous involvement with the Mayor and Bryant in Campaign 1. She is the only member of The Indentured available for the task as [[Aleksei von Nuye]] is now a high ranking [[Inquisitor]] of [[Abadar]], [[Dorovan Divitae]] left the city on a quest of discovery, [[Eden]] and [[Jean Clover]] seemingly vanished, and [[Gradius McKobold]] is imprisoned and awaiting trial.

Calypso accepts the job, and leaves to recruit a team. She ends up recruiting her roommates, Vult and Sumner, and Paracelsus the [[Alchemist]] from the business next to Widgeon's. She is also tracked down by the towering Sergeant Major Bertrand, the aging martial of Maris who offers to come along with as a quartermaster to explore the nation one last time. With a party assembled, the [[Maris Spy Party]] leaves Maris.

**Road to T'Crace** - Sessions 2 - 3
Using a cart and horses provided by Bertrand, the party leaves Maris and crosses into mainland Angelus. Upon reaching a crossroads, Calypso decides to start her journey by traveling to the major trade city of T'Crace instead of the smaller [[Acacia]].

A few hours later, the party comes across abandoned wagons blocking the road. Upon investigating a wagon, Calypso alongside Sumner and Paracelsus meet an awakened animal seemingly suffering from amnesia. Before they can leave the wagon, the party is ambushed by a party of bandits led by a [[Tengu]] [[Bard]] named [[Arno]]. After defeating them, Calypso lets the survivors go free after learning they are failed merchants from T'Crace. After the battle, Calypso learns the bird's name is apparently Covenant, as it is the only name they could remember.
