"Reigns and Rehabilitations" - First summer campaign, hosted in 2023. Players were Tori as [[Calypso Silversong]], Delton as [[Dorovan Divitae]], Alexei as [[Aleksei von Nuye]], Marsh as [[Eden]],  Angie as [[Jean Clover]], and Anthony as [[Gradius McKobold]].  Wells hosted at his house weekly on Wednesdays at 5pm EST.

Party nicknamed [[The Indentured]] by Tori.

The campaign follows [[Inquisitor]]s Aleksei and Dorovan and captives Eden, Jean, Calypso and Gradius as they are forced to work for the [[High Inquisitor]] of the [[Citadel]], [[Urgen Roth]]

Over the course of this journey around the Citadel, the party travels to [[Naasdab]] and [[Maris]] and meet major characters such as [[Adrian Dumpho]], [[Webster Bryant]], [[Nick the Guard]], and the mysterious [[Gradeus]].

After learning of Urgen Roth's [[Lich]]dom and a powerful weapon given by Gradeus, the campaign ends with the destruction of the Citadel as the party launches the cataclysm bomb into the Citadel to prevent Roth's rise to power.

The party is briefly joined by a mercenary companion, a Cleric by the name of [[Celestrus]]
