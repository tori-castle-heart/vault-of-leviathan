Name of the planet and the current dominant power in the world. They are a large and highly militaristic nation, led by the [[Grand Commander]], a [[Despot]] with total control over the nation. The title is named after the historical title of the leader of the [[Leviathan Navy]].

**Succession**
Currently, the leaders tend to be chosen through an event decided upon by the previous leader, this allows for unknown but able people to take the throne, which has worked effectively thus far. Despite the probable lack of any blood ties all leaders are required to take the last name "[[Theodoris]]" in honor of the leader of Leviathan who first brought Leviathan to its position of domination.

As of [[Campaign 1]], A mysterious new leader has risen to power, by the name of [[Suze Theodoris]]. Nothing about this person is known, nor is anything about the event that was used to decide on the succession.

**Current Standing**
Leviathan holds a negative view towards its southern neighbors of [[Angelus]], [[Caliceerom]], and [[The Zidren Desert]]. All three nations were formed in locations previously thought to be inhospitable and not worth the resources and dedication to colonize. Despite ideological differences, these three nations work together in a pseudo-alliance to ensure that Leviathan cannot wage war with any of them, though Leviathan still attempts covert espionage.

**Military**
Both the [[Leviathan Army]] and the [[Leviathan Navy]] are world renowned, though it is their navy that they owe the majority of their successes to.
