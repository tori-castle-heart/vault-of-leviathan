### *Foreword*
*The discussion of magic, much like the discussion of esoteric topics such as ontology or epistemology, is incredibly difficult to articulate, and the matter on how to speak clearly on such a topic is the subject of arduous debate. The author asks that the reader takes the following reading as not a definitive encyclopedia for the subject of magic.*  

Magic is contemporarily classified through four **magical traditions**: [arcane](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Arcane_magic "Arcane magic"), [divine](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Divine_magic "Divine magic"), [occult](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Occult_magic "Occult magic"), and [primal](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Primal_magic "Primal magic") Each tradition wields power over two of the four essences: matter, mind, spirit, and life.

Arcane is of mind and matter
	Primal is of matter and life
		Divine is of life and spirit
			Occult is of spirit and mind

## Categorization of Magic Traditions
- 
	- **Arcane Magic**: is physical laws, these are the fundamental forces of physical reality. The arcane is about using the only truly universal language, mathematics, to define, manipulate and master these laws. Arcane magic is all about how laws act on systems, and internalizing your understanding of those systems so that you may use them to your advantage. As long as something can be documented through laws acting on a system, it can be understood and known.
	  
	- **Divine Magic**: is the manifestation of power derived from deities and other trans-planar entities who exist in fundamentally deific states of reality, lending them a certain power over the universe. There have been gods ever since the beginning of the universe and are destined to persist until its end. Divine magic is the channeling of their power and influence, shaping reality through acts of faith, devotion, and the assertion of divine will.
	  
	- **Occult Magic**: is the manipulation of the power arising from consciousness, intention, and the collective unconscious. It is the art of shaping reality through awareness and the power of experientially understanding, tapping into the potent backdrop of existence where the substance of sapience itself seems to lie. While seemingly reliant on mortal thought, conscious awareness does not necessitate thought, and draws upon a deeper, more fundamental essence that has existed as long as there have been conscious beings.
	  
	- **Primal Magic**: is the harnessing of what permeates and sustain all living systems. The source of this power can be found similarly in the way that it is said that being in the presence of nature seems to ground your being into the present moment. It taps into the ancient wisdom encoded within instinct, the ingrained knowledge forged by necessity across eons. It is the power of growth, adaptation, and survival, reflecting the potent essence of life as it was originally meant to exist, wild and unburdened.

These four magic Traditions bind the four essences together, and in order for magic to manifest from the subject into the object, then one essence must constitute another essence. The mind must know the nature of a fireball, the spirit must know the nature of mending flesh.


## Acquisition of Magic

Among all traditions, magic manifests itself within a subject only when that subject is **known** completely, within and without. 

What this means specifically is that 

When you write something down, your mind remembers that something better. If you write it down a hundred times, you will know it very well. The repeated intention of understanding and knowing something, is what eventually creates the basis for a spell.

When you fully understand the mechanics of how something in a spell works, your memory and conceptualization of that something can be strong enough to manifest in magical effect.

For example, if one wishes to cast a projectile out of thin air, like a fireball, you could learn how vortex rings work , and master the mathematical analysis of said vortex rings and cast a fireball that way. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring
