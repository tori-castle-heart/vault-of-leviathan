The isle of Ipsilon is a continent located entirely within the [[Stormwall|Great Stormwall]], a colossal, world-spanning [hypercane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercane) that renders it impossibly impenetrable from the rest of the planet. The Stormwall covers a vast amount of ground, shielding Ipsilon on all sides, making the isle itself safe but also trapped within its confines. Most inhabitants of the Western world of Leviathan can only guess at what lies deep within the Stormwall, with some speculating about ancient sea dragons.

## Geography

Ipsilon is primarily described as a giant caldera, implying a vast, crater-like landmass. Its unique geographical isolation has allowed it to develop separately from the Western world of Leviathan for nearly a thousand years. Presumably, if the storm has raged for millions of years, then the continent may have been bigger once upon a time, but has since been eroded into a smaller landform.

## History

Approximately a thousand years ago, a seafaring people found themselves persecuted to extinction from all sides, caught between the warring nations of (???) and the fledgling nation of Leviathan. Their last hope lay in the immeasurable power of two of their leaders, one of whom had dominion over the very essence of the storms. Facing annihilation, these two leaders made a sacrifice, the storm-touched unleashed the entire power bound within their person to open a gate within the impassible Stormwall, allowing their people to pass through in safe harbor. This titanic act cost the storm-touched their own life, while the other leader stayed behind to kill off their friend, sealing the entrance before the warships could pursue. This was the last that Leviathan ever saw of these seafarers; however, they went on to create a new world within the storm, which revealed an entire continent within, the isle of Ipsilon. 

Since this exodus, the two worlds have remained untouched and unknown by one another, fostering distinct and separate development, with only a vague memory of the war that came before those thousand years ago.

Despite this profound isolation, some extraplanar and outsider entities are known to traverse between both continents. However, for reasons unknown, these entities never disclose information about one side to the inhabitants of the other. This enforced silence maintains the mystery and separation between the two narratives unfolding on each landmass.

## Narrative

Ipsilon serves as the setting for an entirely distinct narrative, separate from the primary political and social conflicts of Leviathan. This narrative centers around characters such as Cloud, Iggy, Djinn, Merit-Amün, etc. The story of Ipsilon begins with the groundbreaking discoveries of Merit-Amün and the profound consequences of her inventions, particularly [[the Life Seed]].
