## Background 

#### Early life

Before she was known as Historia, she was Hermise: an emissary angel of the heavens, created in the [[Crucible]] to serve the will of the Upper Planes, but primarily Heaven itself. A [Tabellia](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2817) by classification, her existence as an angel was intended to be precise and efficient, a medium for divine missives and motives, and a voice through which Heaven could speak to beings across the Great Beyond and settle disputes. 

Like all angels, Tabellia are a cog in the machine, designed with exactness and specificity, their roles are fixed from the start, designed with precision. While a majority of angels can simply be recycled directly from the souls of virtuous mortals, Tabellia and other higher order angels can only be created in a specialized furnace with incredible energy. The Crucible is a divine foundry built to infuse a chosen soul with raw quintessence. Unlike [Creation's Forge](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Creation's_Forge "Creation's Forge(https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Creation's_Forge)")—whose purpose is to recycle unformed energy back into the cycle of birth and death—the Crucible isolates a single soul and pushes it past its natural limits. Quintessence isn’t just given to the soul, it’s forced into it, until the soul can hold forms and functions far beyond what it could manage on its own. 

Hermise’s incubation within the Crucible was long and volatile. Her ichor, which should have cooled into perfect crystalline logic, ran strangely. Her heart—supposed to focus and distribute conscious thought throughout the blood-mind—formed imperfectly, resulting in a kind of awareness that bore too much resemblance to the minds of mortals.

This narrative does not strictly adhere to the Golarion setting, primarily focusing on Earth rather than the outer planes. Therefore, we can exercise creative license regarding the lore of the outer planes or anything beyond the material plane. Hermise is a powerful individual, a former angel who became a rogue, wandering the planes for centuries before discovering her purpose: to redeem lost souls ostracized by the rigid structures of heaven and the broader cosmos. 

Her backstory begins with Hermise as a tabellia, an emissary angel, who experiences existential dysphoria concerning her purpose and place in the universe. The minds of mortals differ significantly from those of immortals, and Hermise possesses a mind more akin to a mortal's. Crafting a narrative from the perspective of an ostensibly inhuman protagonist within an inhuman society presents a unique challenge, yet it offers an intriguing exploration of themes resonant with outsiders, the marginalized, and those who struggle to conform. This is a story about how Hermise lost her angelic status due to her inability to function as an angel, failing to fulfill her intended role.

To elaborate on her fall, it is necessary to understand the typical duties of a tabellia. While the attributes and properties of a tabellia are detailed at [https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2817](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2817), specific assignments that she could intentionally or inadvertently disrupt are still needed. My current intent is for her to disrupt a mission by accidentally appearing before a council of infernals deep within the Abyss, thereby endangering her assignment. However, this is a later plot point.

Tabellias serve as the celestial realms' elite messengers, delivering divine decrees, conducting reconnaissance for deities and celestial armies, and offering support to those in need. They oversee planar travelers and mentor powerful mortals. Typically, tabellias carry scrolls containing vital messages.

The concept of her being dispatched to Hell as an envoy is particularly compelling. The rationale for assigning her such a significant task stems from Heaven's unfamiliarity with angels deviating from their designated purpose. Angels are designed to be immutable, like automatons, incapable of wavering in choice or will; they are meant to follow a predetermined path. Thus, on her inaugural mission, she would be sent as an envoy to Hell. While she would be briefed on her objective, it would be presumed she inherently understood how to execute it, despite her lack of understanding and her profound empathy for the suffering she encounters in Hell.

However, it may be more effective if her initial assignment is not a monumentous event. Both Hell and Heaven are described as immeasurable; each conflict is but a minuscule ripple in the eternal struggle. Yet, the mistake of this relatively insignificant conflict could escalate when Hell discerns that Heaven has dispatched a flawed angel. They would seize the opportunity to gain an advantage over Heaven, perhaps even acquiring an astral deva. This would be a momentous, unprecedented event. They would "open her up" to study her composition and form, akin to a government analyzing a foreign drone or aircraft.

Alternatively, considering the vast and intricate politics of Heaven and Hell, angels, though seemingly individual and intelligent, might function more as a eusocial entity. Individual angelic lives may not be valued as highly as the collective. In certain conflicts, sacrificing an angel as ransom might be a more prudent option than acceding to greater demands or risking worse outcomes. Therefore, she might be sent as an envoy with the implicit understanding that her return is unlikely. Most angels would willingly sacrifice themselves, understanding their collective existence as part of the cycle of reformation and rebirth for benevolent souls and quintessence into new angels and beings. Thus, dying in Hell would be inconsequential to the grand cosmic scheme, the river of souls' cycle of rebirth. However, unlike other angels, Hermise would possess a fear of death, dreading her predetermined end, fearing death before she even knows what it is to be alive.%%

To integrate these ideas, her first mission could involve delivering a message of significance or initiating a trade of powerful objects. For instance, she might be tasked with bringing a relatively minor artifact from Heaven, such as the Amulet of Everlasting Vigor, to a house of devils. In return, the devils would offer the release of half of their hostage souls- a seemingly worthy deal, but likely a ruse, necessitating a carefully devised plan.

It is probable that the devils would demand the relic first, followed by the deed of souls. However, Heaven would not entertain such capriciousness and would remain steadfast in its position: the freedom of the hostages must precede the devils' reward.

The inherent problem lies in the devils' likely arrangement for a third party (typically demons or other chaotic outsiders) to ambush the emissary party as they depart the devil's house, before they can exit Hell and return to Heaven. While tabellia possess an aura of traveler's amnesty, making attacks on Hermise difficult, it is not impossible for a house of devils, with access to formidable foes, to harm her.

Naturally, this contingency is anticipated, and Heaven would assign a legion of monavic devas to protect Hermise with their lives, literally.

Hermise would arrive with the Amulet of Everlasting Vigor, holding it before the devils, who would salivate at such a prize, slaves to their greed. They would demand its immediate surrender, but she, having been instructed to refuse, would do so. Despite her nervousness, she would feel secure due to the five surrounding devas and the protective amnesty.

Then, the prince in the golden chair would remark, "Ah, well, I suppose it cannot be helped. I suppose we will have to fetch the taskmaster to discuss handing over the ransomed!" A towering door would open, revealing a pit fiend, an arbiter of Hell, one of the most powerful devils below the archdevils. Hermise would shudder, doubting if the devas and her sanctuary could withstand this being.

The taskmaster would demand to inspect the amulet for authenticity before releasing the ransom. One of the devas would retort, "Like hell we will! That thing doesn't leave her neck until we have the forsaken souls in our care."

The taskmaster would calmly state, "She needn't remove it," and would reach through the sanctuary barrier, with significant effort, taking the amulet between two fingers to inspect it. He would smile, confirming its authenticity. Internally, Hermise would be consumed by fear.

The devil in the golden chair would observe, "What a curious thing, I believe your tabellia is rather terrified of the taskmaster here!" One of the devas would dismiss this, "Enough of your nonsense, it's a cheap insult to compare her to a mortal with such an implication."

But the devil would simply laugh, "But see how she quivers! Like a rat being licked by a cat!" Hermise would strive to control her shaking, but to no avail, until the taskmaster withdrew his hand, allowing her to breathe again, despite lacking lungs.

Subsequently, they would agree to release half of their hostage souls. They would proceed to the vault, witnessing hundreds of thousands of piled charters representing the ownership of souls, falsely and illegally held captive from the river of souls. Hermise would weep, realizing that lives and souls were commodified and traded so freely in the infernal realms, exchanged for mere trinkets. The devas would comfort her, assuring her that her feelings, though atypical for a tabellia, were just and warranted, suggesting she might be the sole being to lament their long-past agony. They would affirm that despite her peculiar quirks, her empathy was profoundly inspiring.

Would it be detrimental for these devas, typically ostentatious and boastful, to express such care for her, comforting her as humans would each other? Or would it be more logical for them to leave her, assuming that as a tabellia, she possessed golden resolve and was stronger than them?

Regardless, they would collect the hundred thousand souls and depart, receiving predatory glances from the devils as they exited the house. But as they left, they would realize something was gravely wrong. The house seemed to stretch endlessly, becoming a labyrinth, forcing them to find their way out. The situation would be tense and arduous, as a horde of imps would attempt to reclaim their bounty of souls. However, the devas would be prepared, fighting off the tide of fiends. Eventually, they would find or create an exit. More powerful demons would then emerge, matching the devas, who would slowly succumb to the overwhelming infernal horde. Yet, their lives would not be in vain, as Hermise and the two remaining devas would escape and finally return to Heaven, mission accomplished.

But at what cost?

She would experience survivor's guilt, an emotion she is not meant to feel. She would confide this to the other devas, who would liken her to a mortal saint and note her resemblance to a Balisse rather than a tabellia. She would deliberate whether she should have intervened, as she possessed a weapon.

They would sternly insist that she absolutely should not have. Her sole duty is to be an emissary. It is their responsibility as guardians to protect her; her weapon is only to be used if her aura of sanctuary is at risk of being overwhelmed.

"But if I had used it, I could have potentially saved those other two guardian devas?"

Losing the lives of those two devas is deemed acceptable to avoid the risk of compromising the sanctuary barrier, as they would explain.

"How is that possible? How can I be worth more than you?"

"Haha! That is precisely what a mortal would say! We, however, are not mortal and understand that the loss of individual lives is inconsequential as long as the mission is completed. This is our purpose: we live and die to serve Heaven. It is how the order of heaven has always operated!" and they would forgive her for her inquiries, as being a newborn tabellia and immediately assigned to such a drastic mission must induce some level of unaccounted stress on the mind of even an angel. They would wish her well and hope to see her on the next mission.

but in the next mission, she would befall terrible misfortune.
