### Maris Spy Party

When [[Calypso Silversong|Calypso]] returned to [[Maris]] after her part in the detonation of [[the Citadel]], the Mayor asks her to assemble a team to travel the rest of the country of [[Angelus]] and to investigate each major city and determine their political leaning in the upcoming war. She hired her two roommates [[Vult]] and [[Sumner]] and then her work colleague [[Paracelsus]]. The night after, [[Bertrand]] showed up to her residence requesting to join the party in an attempt to escape his boring cushy desk life. Later, another member, [[Covenant]], would join after surviving a [[Roadside Ambush|roadside ambush]] ambush together with the party.

Overall, their focus is to travel the country of [[Angelus]] and gather as much information as they can for the upcoming internal conflict of the country.
