calypso through her wit bargains her way to a port on the river styx with many planar travellers. eventually finds her way onto a pathfinder ship. (very impressive) (very sneaky)

the people on this pathfinder ship are doing an escort mission for a warlock halfling to stygia, and sometimes its cheaper and even safer to travel through the abyss than it is to seek out the spells of a master spellcaster. or perhaps they are simply seeking some demiplane which is inaccesible otherwise.

-        i need places, interesting places
- wicked libraries to study the sins and lies of all, infernal forges, thieves guilds, dark training grounds, cities, BROTHELS.

this Pathfinder ship consists of not just a typical travelling adventuring party, but around level 7-10 some very accomplished people. cambions and Aiuvarin for sure,.

With these places in mind we can have calypso be a stowaway, and through some trickery and sabatoge cement her stay on this ship and even perhaps have a little adventure with these planar travellers.

maybe this journey will take six or so odd months.

an infestation! while calypso is hiding out within the ship walls as it travels through the abyss, a parasitic missile would seek out and infiltrate the ship, penetrating into the ships inner walls. perhaps calypso herself might even be able to see the penetration whilst it happens! how terrifying!

and then, well, the parasite will unleash poisonous gas into the hold of the ship and incapacitate everyone on board.

except calypso

calypso alone will witness the boarding of dark pirates, abyssal invaders, qlippoths perhaps? i wonder if the invaders should be more monstrous and chaotic, or if they should be an organized, intelligent brigand of abyssal pirates, a relatively rare threat to the abyss all things considered, as it is such an unimaginably large and tumultuous realm.

these pirates, or monsters, would have discovered a way to detect others in the abyss, even from incredibly far physical distances. able to have some sense of detection or perception through the chaotic medium of the outer rifts. (could they steal this power for themselves?)

pirates, they would use some fleshwarped missile that would bore its way through the hard metal hull, a living thing, that once its made its way inside, would secrete from its glands a noxious poison!! fumes spewing out and pungence knocking everyone out hard!! 

how would the pirates bring themselves onto the ship? a short range teleport perhaps, thqt fleshwarped missile acting as the stepping stone as to where that teleport would bring you too, calypso would watch as this fleshwarp would explode and then out would appear a scout looking to open the bay doors to connect to the pirate vessel, which would have freshly shown up next to the pathfinder ship now that its crew is all unconscious.

calypso would pick up on this, and wonder if itd be a good idea to make her move, to potentially reveal herself and make herself vulnerable, not only to these pirates, but to these planar travellers she rides with.

she weighs her options, she has no idea if these pirates are planning to leave the ship on its own after they're through with its course of action. its possible that they might leave the ship destroyed, and then Calypso's only guarantee of safety would be to hop on to the pirate vessel, all without being detected. even then, where would these pirates return to? they probably wouldn't be received at any normal big harbor, as theyd possibly be wanted for crimes they may have committed against the trade, and if they return somewhere dangerous? what possible hope could she have of making it to the blind woman? this passage of trade through the few places in the abyss that have even some semblance of order and safety, it was her best, and possibly only realistic hope of making it. even so, the danger posed by the abyssal pirates seems great and what if these people are doomed anyways?

she decides that her best shot at influencing the odds is to cut off the scout here and now. but what then? how will the pirates react? only time will tell, and for someone like calypso there is only the immediate next step.










This all came crashing down, however, when she anonymously exposed the disloyalty of a devil named SÃ¼tre, leading to his near execution and a catastrophic loss of status.
