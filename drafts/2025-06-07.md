1. she is recruited into an underground adventurer's guild – a ragtag group that values results over form, and while she doesn't like working with others, she sees the advantage in being part of a well-connected network. she keeps her distance and her secrets close, but knows that sometimes having partners is better than being alone.

2. the guild is assigned to investigate a suspicious area in the catacombs – reports of missing people and failed scout missions have reached the higher-ups. the area is said to be cursed or haunted by something dark. calypso, with her keen eye for traps and secrets, is the natural choice to lead the investigation, even if it means working with people she deems beneath her.

3. the group enters the dark, winding corridors beneath the city. the air is heavy and the silence is broken only by distant echoes. they search methodically, but nothing seems out of place – until calypso spots a false door hidden behind a tattered tapestry and weathered stone. her eyes narrow as she signals the group to follow her lead.

4. beyond the false door lies a hidden passageway that follows deeper into the crypts.  until the party stumbles upon a glyph of blasting, which upon being triggered knocks away everyone in different directions, separating and isolating them.

5. one by one, calypso will encounter traps alone, detect them, and carefully sidestep them without setting them off. Then a few moments later we witness another party member encounter the exact same trap, fail to notice, and become ensnared and killed. and this whole process will repeat over and over, calypso evades traps, others become fall victim.
   
6. eventually calypso will regroup with two of her other party members, a spearthrower fighter and a scroll savant wizard. she evades traps while they follow her lead, and eventually they will make their way to a great opening in the halls, with potions and bottles and tools organized neatly everywhere. they have wandered into a labratory or lair of some kind.

7. calypso, sensing a dark presence deeper in the shadows, decides to hide prematurely without notifying the others.  in the following moment, a skeletal figure with a bird skull for a head draped in shadowy robes looms out of the darkness, its bony white contrasting with the grey fog around them.

8. the fighter reacts immediately, lancing a spear at the deathly creature with an atlatl, and as the spear lands right in the eye socket of the skull, there is no sound and no indication that the spear made contact with anything at all, as if it was swallowed up into nothingness.

9. the spearfighter charges at once, leaving nothing up to chance, but the bony white apparition opens its cloak like a matador's cape, enveloping the fighter in a silent, dark embrace. in an instant, the fighter is gone.

10. it remarks, "three...," as if noting a score. its words carry an almost detached curiosity. it turns its gaze to the wizard, staff clutched in hand.
%%should he really be talking so much? what if i wanted to give him an aire of mystery, as if it was unclear if he was even registering them as human sentient beings, if he was even anything more than a monster. wouldnt it then be more suspenseful for calypso to save herself out of that one?%%
11. the wizard, panicked and desperate, makes a break for the exit. but as soon as they pull out their teleportation scroll, they feel a cold, numbing grip on their mind. that bony white apparition silently and instantly behind them, forcing a hand into their mind as it steals their arcane knowledge, leaving them paralyzed and horrified. they clutch their now-useless scroll as they collapse in shock.

12.  "only three outliers?" it fingers with an invisible wisp as if turning the stolen arcane knowledge over in its bony hand. "it is not as if there have been any recent breakthroughs in the arcane as of recent." an uninterested and apathetic tone, to indicate it has seen hundreds of wizards in his time

13. its gaze turns to calypso, still lurking in the dark. "and what about you? are you to explain for this outlier?".   calypso, reeling from shock, not from witnessing two deaths, but from being found out whilst hiding, fails to answer. it follows up its question, "i do not know why i bother asking questions" as it reaches out its bony white hand to presumably steal the knowledge out of her brain. 

14. she stammers to her feet. "no need for that ehehe, im the outlier mister bone man! i saw the traps and they just followed." sweat beads down her forehead, it takes everything in her power to not let the terror show on her face.

15. it assesses her, looking at her with those two hollow sockets. "i suppose i can see how someone of your lineage would be able to see through these particular kinds of traps. what an interesting coincidence."

16. but at the mention of coincidence she twitches in annoyance. "that was no coincidence, i saw those traps because im good at sneaking past traps." though she regrets having said it as soon as she opened her mouth.

17. it eyes her with one side of its head, "curious how even in the face of mortality, mortals are still seeking to best one another in games of skill".

18. she gulps. "you're going to kill me?"  to which she is answered with silence. she continues "why do you have to kill me?"

19. the wizard, who up to this point has been watching the whole scene play out, finally breaks and decides its either run or die and they may as well take a chance. they bolt for the exit, but not before the reaper points a bony finger at them and they fall to the ground, instantly paralyzed. it answers her, "because i must, of course

20.
