omg what if i had a cool gadget, like a lock, YES,  throwable lock of some kind, and when i throw it at any door or openable container, the door will automatically close and Lock under the effects of the level 2 lock spell AND its also a strong functional lock in a physical light. Meaning its like a quick porrtable way to lock doors behind you as you throw it.


in fact i think itd be cool to generalize and expand this concept into a broader application of spells and cantrips. i mean just imagine being able to throw cards of daze and not only can you throw cards at people and papercut them, but you also deal some slight mental damage and also daze them!! or perhaps a touch attack? like a touch of combustion!

imagine a card of fireball, it would be like  , like a WAND or a SCROLL, but instead of rolling spell attack, you would roll your ranged attack roll for darts. 

this kind of application is applicable for darts and special arrows as well. an eldritch archer can reasonably apply these applications, and so i suppose that the gadget im inventing as a magical activation ranged projectile.
