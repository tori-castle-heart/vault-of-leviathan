a monent of silence is for the liars, the losers, the bastards, the criminals, the broken, the forgotten, etc etc etc

i like the idea of queen historia: bulwark of bastards.

i like the idea that queen historia is this buddha-like figure who has given her own blood and soul to the effort of making a home and space where the most miserable of people can go to remake themselves into new people,

the idea that if someone was given an ample amount of time, power, and will, that they could make this kind of place. if the buddha can redeem a murderer into a monk, then so can queen historia

the idea is that she is able to do this by entering the minds of her denizens by dreamwalking, and not only can she do this, but she can compress the time spent within these dreams to impossible lengths, dedicating a rather substantial amount of time to each individual person, breaking down every influence that has molded them into the person they currently are. and then in doing so she could truly make a utopia.

I want to be able to base my building of queen historias character a real foundation of spirituality and the buddha, i want to be able to make her genuinely think of what the best course of action is with her state of power in order to make as much of a change towards universal goodness as possible. she wants to have as many people helped as possible. especially those who are only "evil" because of the things done to them.

if the buddha was given infinite time, what would he do?
What would be the side effects of her trying to enact this in such a way. how would the people react, would there be side effects to dreams from the queen? what would teh buddha do really? what did he do eith his time on earth?

I mean, for historia, would she really become overwhelmed? could jesus, or the buddha become overwhelmed? she has been through so much already, and she is not a mortal, she is a celestial who has ascensed past her limitations, what could possibly weigh her down?

for  the city, i think that any malevolent deities or such would firstly have a very difficult time breaching such a place, and also this could even be a source of conflict that the players of this campaign could deal with. 

perhaps her city faces against demons and qlippoths surging towards the city at all times from rifts at the edge, and thousands of volunteers lay down their lives to keep the place safe so that historia can maintain this oasis. the freedom fighters who fight off the demontide

as for how the people react, i have to wonder, would she ever misstep in her efforts to turn everyone towards the light? would she ever accidentally make someone eternally afraid of her, or obsessed with her, or miss the point she is trying to make? it depends entirely on her and how much time she has.

is she capable of mistakes? was the buddha?

If the gods are the pinnacle of power in this universe, then why do they not do what queen historia does? does iomedae show the same effort? does desna? etc This feels a lot like how people will feel disillusioned with religions in real life, "if God is so kind, then why does he allow Rape, torture, murder, strife, etc?"
	(smth important to note is that )

i believe this is a common argument, and the response i hear from spiritual people like ram dass is "it is all perfect, step back from your humanity to see how perfectly it is all unfolding? have you the courage to see what it is that you see? or are you afraid that it will take away your humanity?"

what people do is they form a veil, a shield around their heart, because they cannot handle the entirety of suffering that exists, their heart cannot take it. and so they create a boundary for their heart

i think the difference is that historia does not need to guard her heart in the way that the mortals do, she is able to see the boundlessness of her own heart, and open it to all the suffering and misery of the universe. and with that she can rule her kingdom through her heart.

this is helped by what she once thought was to be her worst mistake, it was when she ate her heart. 

in the epitome of her misery and debauchery, she could not handle the pain of suffering and so she ate her own heart. afterwards she developed a sort of psychopathy, and believed herself incapable of performing even as a good celestial, as she no longer had a heart to tell her how to feel, and to feel for her. but eventually she came to realize that what she ate was more akin to an angels mind rather than her heart. for in doing so it gave her the ability to learn to lose her boundary and to open her soul completely.

this is her.


but how did she come to create this land? and what of the trials and history she had before a moment of silence?

for certain i think i want a moment of silence to be the dreamspace of a dreaming nirvana gigas, perhaps one that she once knew very well and was maybe even deeply intertwined with. and perhaps they came to a great conflict at the end of a very very long adventure. one that led her through all great planes in the outer sphere. one that had her come into constant conflict and battle with the underlings of The Black Hand, and one that would forge her into the legendary figure that she is today.

but the end of that adventure would come when she slayed her friend the dreaming gigas, and used its mind to essentially create a realm

how did that realm come to be in the abyss? who knows, maybe thats where the fight took them, maybe that act of treachery sunk her down to that level, maybe it was something to do with the black hand, but it needs to be explained
