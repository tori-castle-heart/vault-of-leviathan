Calypso is a freelance spy aloft in the world of Leviathan with a legacy of abysmal luck and infernal influence. Shaped by a traumatic 7-year exile in [Hell](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Hell), she presents a snarky, calculated exterior to hide deep vulnerabilities and utilizes manipulation, subterfuge, and magic to navigate the world and ensure she's never powerless again.
## Personality

Sharp as a razor's edge and unsettlingly eccentric, Calypso navigates the world through meticulously constructed layers of performance. Her outward persona shifts to suit her company: sometimes a witty, disarming scoundrel, sometimes the quiet critic hardly seen- but always a deliberate mask designed to keep others at bay and ensure they see only what she presents. Within this social chameleon lies a neurotic, frenzied mind, haunted by the constant fear of betrayal and obsessed with maintaining control at all costs, even resorting to nightly dreamwalking of her allies to profile details and gather secrets for leverage. This profound distrust is the scar tissue from navigating the volatile politics of [Dis](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dis), where she learning the hard way that respect does not equal trust led to devastating betrayal; she now operates under the conviction that vulnerability is a fatal weakness awaiting exploitation. This guarded existence is maintained by a formidable willpower that saw her survive Hell itself- though whether this resilience is her own or an inheritance from her [[Silversong Matriarch#Lineage|lineage]] remains ambiguous. Self-aware of her own manipulative nature, Calypso harbors few illusions about her own capacity for true friendship, perhaps resigned to the belief that genuine connection is a dangerous impossibility for the likes of someone like her.
 
Despite how she is in present day, prior to her exile, Calypso was a carefree child. Though a fair bit mischievous, always playing pranks on her peers and poking fun at the passers-by. Additionally, she was fascinated by magic and tried desperately to learn it in an attempt to attain individuality and strength. Despite this, she didn't have a very studious disposition, and took poorly to her classes, even private ones proctored by [[Broomhilda]]. Eventually she learns to ditch learning arcane magic the traditional wizard way and discovers her affinity for occult magics instead, and Broomhilda helps Calypso foster her own style of spellcasting leading to her eventual discovery of sorcery. She adopts a more improvisational practice of magic guided by intuition, which would reflect her problem solving style later in life.

is she naive? yes, i would say she generally does not learn to fear much or fear anyone in particular, her home environment, despite not luxurious, is still safe. harvey did his best to give her safety, and that she does have.

is she impressionable? yes, her  two biggest interests were drawing and magic, the latter of which she picked up from broomhilda, her de facto mother figure. it was present in her life and she felt a special connection. she also thinks fighting and stuff is really cool, because harvey is a reals deals merc!

## Background 

#### Childhood and early life

Calypso and her origins are both shrouded by an ever-shifting blanket of lies, and it is unlikely that she will ever tell the truth of how she came to be to anyone willingly. Though an exception can be made for soothsayers and deeply practiced mind readers. Thus, the only one able to see her in all her history is [[Historia Castleheart]].

Calypso was born in [[Eclipta]], a rustic village that was once in the eastern country of the [[Al-Rackic]] peninsula, born under [[Harvey Silversong]] and his then wife, Fellacia[^1]. But tragedy soon struck, as a band of raiders showed up to ransack the village, and Harvey, mysteriously, fled the city with baby Calypso as the village burned down to the ground behind the both of them.

Seeking asylum, Harvey and his daughter, Calypso, soon arrived in the city of [[Cairnridge]]. Raising Calypso alone, Harvey signed up to be a militiaman, but the city's lack of need for an active mercenary force meant his only real work could be as a guard or laborer, resulting in low pay. For a time, they resided in a community center until [[Broomhilda]], the local witch, offered them a room to rent in her attic. Eventually, they could afford their own house, though this was only possible because Harvey took on the additional role of executioner, a job burdened by superstition and ill repute.

During her childhood, Calypso was well-liked by the local populace, who were mostly charmed by her cheeky and disarming nature. Her father, however, became something of an outcast in the city. This was partly due to his role as executioner and partly due to the townsfolk's fear of rumors about brigand raids, where insider spies would weaken towns before they were attacked. As Calypso grew older, her changeling lineage became more apparent, and people grew wary of her, associating her more closely with her father. Despite this growing negativity, Broomhilda remained a consistent source of support for both Calypso and Harvey.

When she was nine years old, Calypso made an attempt to enroll in the local children's school so that she may learn to read and write; however, Harvey lacked the funds to be able to send her to school. Calypso would resort to pretending to be a student anyways, which would work for some time until she was eventually caught by the headmaster and evicted from the school. She still ended up learning much, from the few friends she made whilst she was there, stealing some school textbooks, and being homeschooled by Broomhilda.

For as long as she could remember, she has been fascinated by magic from learning of it in school and witnessing it in her city. She often asked Broomhilda to teach her magic, though Broomhilda was always wary of doing so, seeing as Harvey wasn't excited at the idea of his daughter being a witch. After enough pestering, Broomhilda relented and agreed to teach her one cantrip. Calypso sought out to learn how cast her first cantrip, prestidigitation, but had much trouble in learning arcane magics, failing to produce results. After much arduous practice, Calypso became dejected, but Broomhilda encouraged her to not feel constricted to the methods taught to her, and that she should try to go about it in any way she can think of.

> "Magic is just solving a puzzle, its alright if you don't solve it by the standard! It just matters if you can solve it at all, even if its in your own way."

This helped Calypso discover that she had the propensity to cast even without understanding the concrete lessons of wizardry. Calypso soon manifested her first traces of magic, not through a conceptual manifestation, but through... *daydreaming?*
	Indeed, the very first magic Calypso ever managed to cast was in the midst of daydreaming about magic itself. 

> "I dunno what I did! I just, dunno... I was just kinda musing about it, I didn't really realize what I was doing until it was happening, and then as soon as I realized I snapped out of it and it stopped."

Broomhilda detected a strange presence within her, the blood of a hag's daughter. Quietly, she solemnly confirmed to herself a theory of Calypso and Harvey's origins that she always had suspected to be true. Regardless, She congratulated Calypso and encouraged her to develop this new power. Amusingly, as she developed her skills further, Calypso was convinced that she had finally become a wizard, and even prided herself on being a better wizard than the other students because she didn't have to prepare her spells like the other students did. Completely convinced that she was a wizard, she started showing off her magic to other kids in the town square, much to the ire and surprise of the residents.

This began to draw the ever-anxious eye of [[Douglas Zacharias]], one of Cairnridge's clerics of Iomedae, whom began to notice that strange and dark energy emanating from the pale girl with sharp teeth and her outsider father who refused to speak of his vague origin.

His suspicions weren't unjustified, Calypso indeed was someone of dangerous importance, the changeling daughter of one of the most dreadful beings to plague the countryside of Angelus, the [[Silversong Matriarch]]. Though Calypso herself didn't know that truth herself, Broomhilda had nearly deduced to herself the true origin of Calypso's magic being her lineage. While Douglas did not fully know where she came from, his devotion as a cleric and prelate gave him an innate sense that there was something dangerous about her.

Calypso would continue to grow up and would have a relatively normal if not troubled childhood up until the age of twelve, in which her practice with Broomhilda would culminate in the first casting of her second level spell, [Daylight](https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=daylight). Unfortunately, this would backfire, and instead she would cast [Darkness](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1480), immediately shrouding all of the surrounding road in a thick black eminence. All of the townsfolk in sight of the situation would stop, stare, and point at the anomaly before them. Although Cairnridge was a considerably wealthy town, and the citizens there have definitely seen plenty more spells cast than the average peasant does, they would not have seen many spells of occult tradition, and especially any related to shadow.

Douglas, sensing something was amiss, arrived at the scene just as Calypso cast her second-level spell. He saw the magic as a sign of a dark source of power, which confirmed his suspicions that Calypso was more than she appeared. He immediately began to interrogate her on the nature of her power , but when she was unable to answer, he assumed the worst and moved to restrain her. True to her father's words to always fight back, Calypso resisted, which severely backfired.

As a crowd gathered, an anxious Douglas had guards restrain her while he spoke of the threat of supernatural forces and hag covens using insider spies. He pointed to Calypso as evidence, highlighting her strange features and changeling heritage, and warning that she could be called back to the coven to become a hag herself and lead destruction back to town.


### All is blind in pride and prejudice
	
	Harvey arrived and confronted Douglas, and neither man was willing to back down. In a twisted mix of pride and desperation, Douglas opened a portal to Hell to visually demonstrate his adamance on the danger of a hag. 
	In order to defend herself, Calypso struck Douglas with a telekinetic projectile whilst Harvey charged forth place himself between them. 
	Douglas quickly shook off the stun and readied himself for the coming blow. In the ensuing strike, Harvey grappled and struck Douglas' head on the ground. Douglas uncoupled a wand of Dazzling Flash and struck everyone in the area, including the guards holding Calypso.
	With this, the guards holding Calypso stumbled back, and lost their grip on her. The maw of hell had a magnetic attraction to it, and Calypso was whisked away.
	Douglas, being beaten unconscious, could no longer maintain the spell open anymore and it closed as soon as Calypso fell through. Immediately after, a horrified Harvey was beaten unconscious by the pair of guards as he was dragged away from Douglas' body.
	and so Calypso fell, and fell, and fell.


#### Calypso in Hell

After being sent to Hell by dimensional gate spell, Calypso's early years were spent in the city of Dis, a lawful evil city ruled by the archdevil Dispater. In a place where the meek serve the mighty, she quickly learned that her best chance at survival was to stay out of sight. With food being scarce, she became a skilled rat and scavenger, using her abilities to steal from planar travelers and butchers.

During this time, she would also make frequent use of [hellmouths](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Hellmouth) and interplanar portals in order to frequent the many planar isles up and down the [river styx](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/River_Styx) which planar travellers would frequent the most often. During this time, she not once ever found a portal which led to anywhere outside the [three unholy planes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Great_Beyond#Planes), though she had little use for any planes in Abbadon aside from the [Slave City of Awaiting-Consumption](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Awaiting-Consumption).

Over time, Calypso learned the value of information and honed her skills to become a cunning information broker and spy. To the devils and daemons, she was the Ghost of Dismas Alley, a thief-taker and go-between who gathered information on escaped slaves, lost property, and disloyal deserters in exchange for large sums of money. Once she made use of visiting the other popular tourist spots in the unholy three, she also began to feed herself more frequently from stealing and scamming planar travelers, notably within [Taste of Anguish](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Taste_of_Anguish), [Alushinyrra](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Alushinyrra), and the [Cathedral Thelemic](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cathedral_Thelemic).

But everything changed when she exposed the traitor Sütre, a devil whose desire for revenge outmatched her proficiency to stay undetected.
	Enraged, Sütre eventually tracked her down while she was selling a fake potion, catching her off guard and raping her. Calypso, fighting back like a cornered animal managed to escape and mortally wound her assailant, but the experience left her deeply traumatized. 
		That night, in the deepest and darkest of alleyways, she had a vision of a woman in a white robe with blue wings over her eyes, who told her she was not alone in her suffering and could find respite if she ventured deep into the Outer Rifts and sought out the lady's domain.
Now with a real purpose and journey in mind, Calypso sought to adventure further into the reaches of the abyss. Her travels eventually led her to stow away on a Pathfinder ship, where she hid in the ship's walls as it traveled through the Abyss. Her life as a spy, criminal, and survivor in the outer planes deeply shaped her, leaving her with a profound fear of betrayal and an obsession with maintaining control at all costs.

## Abilities

Calypso sports a wide range of abilities sourced from her sorcery, heritage, and skills acquired with ruthless acumen.

- **Class Abilities:**
    - **Shadow-Sorcerer**
	    - [Cloak of Shadow](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1790): cloaking herself in a dark emanation, she has been known to fight while under cover of obscure darkness. Making nearly all assailants have to simply guess where to swing or strike.
	    - [Shroud of Darkness](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=2360): In the rare case where someone with darkvision can see through her darkness, she has the ability to cloak any target in particular with shadow to lower the level of light that they see.
    - **Rogue**
	    - **Sneak attack:** As any typical rogue, Calypso's attacks deal more severe damage against targets off-guard to her. However, she has also been able to leverage this advantage when casting melee spells, such as [Umbral Extraction](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1211).
- **Lineage Abilities:**
    - **Moon-may**: An exception of hag biology, due to her heritage being the spawn of a [night-hag](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Night_hag), Calypso has a strong connection with sleep. Healing rapidly during sleep and being able to resist magical sleep effects.
	 - **Oneiromancy**: Her night-hag lineage also gives her a propensity for dreamwalking magic, which allows her to enter the mind of anyone who sleeps so long as she can meditate next to them. 
    - **Cold-Iron Claws:** She has thick claws, even thicker than the usual changeling's claws, almost resembling that of an [Annis-Hag](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Annis_hag#Changelings). They have been magically infused with [Cold-Iron](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2916&Redirected=1) so that she always have a level of defense against demons even if she is completely unarmed.
	- **Mist Child:** Her silhouette seems to dissolve once she [blends into the shadows](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=4538&Redirected=1).
- **Mundane Skills:**
    - **Spymaster:** Being an infernal informant taught her a lot about information gathering, subterfuge, infiltration, and espionage.
    - **Criminal Background:** Her time in [Dis](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dis) also taught her about navigating the criminal underworld, and dirty tactics like how to mug, interrogate, blackmail, and subvert legal systems.
    - **Eagle-eye:** Keen eye for traps and secrets of all kinds, such as when she narrowly avoided every trap in [[Frisier]]'s labyrinth in the underhalls
    - **Improviser:** Has an uncanny acumen for landing herself in situations she has no idea how to escape and yet being able to jerry-rig a solution out of it.
    - **Quick-learner**: is able to rapidly train different needed skills under short circumstance, like when she learns the fundamentals of how to play poker effectively to shut [[Sumner]] up about "learning a thing or two".
    - **Manipulator:** Uses personality and aura effectively to leverage others into doing what she desires.

## Weaknesses
- Despite being such a roach in terms of survival, her actual constitution and physical prowess is nothing to boast. Notably, despite proving effective at escaping pursuers on foot, she mostly does this employing her trickery and foresight rather than athletics. 
- For the sake of even gaining a little more strength or advantage, Calypso is willing to considerably risk herself or others just so that she may claim it. This can be seen in the way that she fights, in the [[Roadside Ambush|roadside ambush]] on the way to [[T'crace]] she risks placing herself directly in the middle of a group of brigands for the mere opportunity to surprise all of them at once and split their forces in two.
## Equipment
- **Cloak of Shadow-walking:** A gift from [[Widgeon]], She received this gift after securing a trade deal for her magic shop. Whenever Calypso takes a life, she becomes invisible for six seconds.
